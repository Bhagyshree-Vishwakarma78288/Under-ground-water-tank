I worked on the Underground Water Tank (UGT) project, focusing on structural detailing and design optimization to ensure durability, water-tightness, and load-bearing capacity.

Project Summary: Underground Tank (UGT) Design
I worked on the Underground Water Tank (UGT) project, focusing on structural detailing, durability, and water-tightness to ensure efficient and long-lasting water storage. The design was developed to withstand soil pressure, water load, and external environmental factors while maintaining ease of maintenance.

Key Contributions:
Structural detailing of base slab, walls, and roof slab to ensure strength and stability.
Load calculations and reinforcement design, considering soil pressure, hydrostatic forces, and external loads.
AutoCAD-based 2D drawings for accurate layout, reinforcement detailing, and execution.
Waterproofing techniques to prevent leakage and ensure long-term durability.
Ventilation and access provisions for proper air circulation and easy maintenance.
Material selection and quality control, ensuring compliance with structural and safety standards.
This project enhanced my expertise in water storage structures, focusing on structural integrity, efficiency, and longevity while meeting functional and safety requirements.
